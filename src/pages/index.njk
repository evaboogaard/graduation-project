    <p class="body popout"><a class="exception-link" href="#p-1">Typography is an ancient and noble craft, dating back to the days when monks meticulously hand-drew letters while cursing their quills. Today, we have the privilege of choosing fonts with a mere click, yet somehow, we still manage to mess it up.</a></p>

    <h2><a class="exception-link" href="#h2-1">The War of the Fonts</a></h2>
    <p><a class="exception-link" href="#p-2">There are two kinds of people in the world: those who use Helvetica and those who use Comic Sans. The former are design purists, the latter enjoy chaos. Somewhere in the middle, Times New Roman sits quietly, waiting for someone to remember it exists.</a></p>

    <p><a class="exception-link" href="#p-3">The battles are fierce: Serif vs. Sans-Serif, Monospace vs. Proportional, Blackletter vs. "That Weird Handwriting Font That No One Can Read." Each believes they are superior. But in reality, the only true loser is Papyrus.</a></p>

    <div class="details full-width p-l-xl">
      <blockquote class="quote extend serif"><a class="exception-link" href="#quote-1">“Choosing the wrong font is like wearing Crocs to a job interview – it sends a message, and not a good one.”</a></blockquote>
      <a href="#btn-controls" class="btn-default-bg btn-default-text btn-hover-bg btn-hover-text btn-focus-outline btn-styling">Choose Wisely</a>
    </div>

    <p><a class="exception-link" href="#p-4">Fonts have personalities. Arial is the dependable office worker who gets things done. Garamond is the refined intellectual with a taste for fine literature. Impact is the guy at the gym who only works on his upper body. And then there’s Wingdings, the drunk uncle who shows up at weddings speaking a language no one understands.</a></p>

    <div class="alert popout">
      <a class="exception-link" href="#alert-1">
        <h3 class="pb-xs">Warning: Font Crimes</h3>
        <p>Using too many fonts in a single design is a crime punishable by graphic designers rolling their eyes so hard they sprain something. Stick to two or three fonts, unless you want your text to look like a ransom note.</p>
      </a>
    </div>

    <p><a class="exception-link" href="#p-5">And while we’re on the subject of font crimes: Stretching text unnaturally is a sin. If you want a wider font, choose one. Don’t force Arial to be something it’s not. Arial has been through enough.</a></p>

    <p><a class="exception-link" href="#p-6">Kerning, the spacing between letters, is also an art. Too tight, and your words become an unreadable mess. Too loose, and your sentence looks like it’s in the process of breaking up. Balance is key.</a></p>

    <h2><a class="exception-link" href="#h2-2">Typographic Hierarchy: Making Text Behave</a></h2>

    <p><a class="exception-link" href="#p-7">Imagine a dinner party where no one knows who’s supposed to be speaking. That’s what happens when you ignore typographic hierarchy. Headings, subheadings, and body text all play their roles. Mixing them up is like putting a toddler in charge of the wine list.</a></p>

    <p><a class="exception-link" href="#p-8">Size matters. Your heading should not be smaller than your paragraph text unless you enjoy confusing your readers. And bold is for emphasis, not for entire paragraphs. Don’t shout at your readers – they’ll leave.</a></p>

    <div class="full-width p-l-xl">
      <blockquote class="quote extend"><a class="exception-link" href="#quote-2">“If everything is bold, then nothing is bold.”<br><span> – A Frustrated Designer</span></a></blockquote>
    </div>

    <div class="extend">
      <a class="exception-link double-column stack-m" href="#double-column-1">
        <section>
          <p class="pb-m">Some fonts are born elegant, like Baskerville — the font equivalent of wearing a tailored suit to breakfast. Others, like Courier, look like they’ve been typing screenplays in a coffee shop since 1997 and are proud of it. And let’s not forget Futura, the one trying a bit too hard to be taken seriously at design school.</p>

          <p>Choosing a font is like casting an actor in a role. You wouldn’t ask Danny DeVito to play a romantic lead in a Nicholas Sparks adaptation — unless you’re going for something very specific. Fonts, too, must match the tone of the message. A legal contract written in Lobster would raise more than a few eyebrows.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p class="pb-m">There’s also the matter of font pairing. Like wine and cheese, some fonts complement each other beautifully — others just make a mess. A clean sans-serif headline paired with a readable serif body? Chef’s kiss. Two competing display fonts in the same sentence? That’s just asking for typographic whiplash.</p>

          <p>In the end, typography is less about rules and more about rhythm, feeling, and common sense. If your design whispers rather than screams, guides rather than overwhelms, and looks good even before someone reads it — congratulations, you’ve made your fonts behave.</p>

    <h2><a class="exception-link" href="#h2-3">The Final Word on Fonts</a></h2>
    <p><a class="exception-link" href="#p-9">Typography is not just about letters; it’s about personality, readability, and making sure your audience doesn’t suffer an eye strain-induced meltdown. Choose wisely, space generously, and for the love of all things legible, never, ever use Papyrus.</a></p>

    <p><a class="exception-link" href="#p-10">And if all else fails, just use Helvetica. No one ever got fired for using Helvetica.</a></p>
